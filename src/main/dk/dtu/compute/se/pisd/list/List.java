 * A list of {@see java.lang.Integer} values. An arbitrary number of values
 * can be added to the list at a given position. The values can be obtained
 * from the list from any position.
 * 
 * Note that we use the class {@see java.lang.Integer} here instead of a data type
 * for two reasons: first, we will extend this class later for defining
 * lists for other types than integers; second, using the class
 * {@see java.lang.Integer} allows us to return null as a result,
 * in case of errors (note that this will be improved later by using
 * exception handling).
